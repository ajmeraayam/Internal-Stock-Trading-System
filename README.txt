Note - The program might not run on IDE, so use console to run this

To run the program

Compile the SocketServer and Client in two different consoles (javac SocketServer.java and javac Client.java). 
Now, run server first (java SocketServer). Then run client (java Client).
Enter s or l in client console to either create an account or log in to an existing account.
Enter the details asked for.
I have added a file to test login functionality without calling signup functionality. Username is the filename
File stores data in this manner -> (first name, last name, username, email id, password)

Rest of the functionalities can be integrated in this program as soon as we have tested them.
